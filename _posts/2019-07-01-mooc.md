title: Co-viewing and Timeline-anchored Discussion for Connectivity and Learning

People like co-viewing videos for information, interaction, and entertainment. To support discussion during viewing online videos, many platforms provide functions of commenting anchored to video timelines. Though the <dfn info="弹幕 in Chinese">timeline-anchored commenting</dfn> is asynchronic, it can mimic a synchronic co-viewing experience. It has become popular in China. For example, a timeline-anchored video sharing platform [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) has attracted over 130 million active users. Many of them watch timeline-anchored videos for informational purposes or informal learning. Some Bilibili users even reposted lecture videos of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs, such as courses on Coursera) and attracted millions of viewing and thousands of comments (e.g., [a course about machine learning](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV164411b7dx?p=1)).  

Though timeline-anchored commenting may facilitate interaction, it may also bring visual clutters, information overwhelming, and mental workload. Timeline-anchored comments overlaid on videos are also usually transient and cannot be replyed. Therefore, it is hard to support in-depth discussions during learning.  

Therefore, I did a series of studies to design for timeline-anchored discussion and facilitating connectivity and cognitive learning. First,

Many people enroll in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) because MOOCs share high-quality educational resources anytime and anywhere. Compared with learning in classrooms, MOOC learning requires learners’ motivation and interactions in the community more, but current MOOC platforms cannot well support interactions. As a result, learners rarely learn MOOCs continually or discuss through forums. Danmaku commenting, which shows discussions anchored to video timelines, supports passive socialization and provides an experience of pseudo-synchronic co-viewing. Inspired by it, this study investigated the motivations to enroll in MOOCs or to view Danmaku videos, and designed tools supporting discussions anchored to the video timeline, to enhance interactions, improve educational presence, and increase learning outcomes.  

This study consists of three stages. In the first stage, this study figured out motivations to enroll in MOOCs and how these motivations affected interactions, presence, and learning outcomes by a survey involving 646 valid responses. Then, by focus groups and a survey involving 248 valid responses, this study clarified how Danmaku video viewing was affected by gratifications, hindrances, and viewers’ individual differences. In the second stage, the study designed and evaluated a tool to facilitate video timeline-anchored discussions named DanMOOC by the user-centered approach. It showed comments and threads both embedded in the video and listed aside. It was evaluated by an experiment involving 28 participants. The study also explored how learning was affected by the layout and the content of timeline-anchored discussions by an experiment with 40 participants. In the third stage, the study designed a visualization tool by analyzing and presenting discussion data. It showed the perceived difficulty, the relevance of discussions with the course content, and the topics of discussions in the lecture video interface. It was evaluated by an experiment with 24 participants.  

This study showed the following results. First, motivations to enroll in MOOCs significantly affected interactions, presence, and learning outcomes. Most learners reported low motivation levels or avoidance of social interactions during learning. The asocial learners tried to focus on learning materials rather than discussions. Their social presence could increase cognitive learning but decrease satisfaction. Therefore, this study tried to make discussions more accessible with the useful information highlighted. Danmaku commenting could satisfy the needs of information and entertainment, social connectedness, and self-expression. These merits potentially helped learning. However, when the comments increased, viewers may feel distracted. Second, the experiment showed that with DanMOOC, participants engaged more in discussions and had higher presence and satisfaction. With the embedded layout, learners switched more frequently between the discussion and the lecture video. They recalled more task-oriented discussions involving surface cognitive processing. The separate layout helped information retrieval when presenting deep processing discussions. Third, the visualization tool could help information retrieval and summarization, increase social presence, and improve learning outcomes.  

This study highlighted the effect of motivation to learn MOOCs on both the learning process and outcomes. It showed how timeline-anchored discussions helped passive socialization, active participation in discussions, and information retrieval and integration in MOOC learning. It explored how learning was improved by the visualization of discussion data. It also provided valuable information for the design of video discussion and annotation tools.

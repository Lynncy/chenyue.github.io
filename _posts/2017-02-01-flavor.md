We compared pros and cons of different methods for measuring emotion evoked by flavors of oral care products, including both self-report and physiological measurements, i.e. EEG, EMG, skin conductance, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration rate. We found EEG data can reliably indicate emotion valence and arousal. Questionnaires were more sensitive to distinguish emotions evoked by different flavors, but may be affected by the halo effect. We also applied these methods to evaluate new oral care products of P&G Technologies (Beijing) Ltd.

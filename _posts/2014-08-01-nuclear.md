To improve performance during emergence, we designed an integrated display of emergency operation procedures and device information for operators in advanced control rooms in nuclear power plants. We compared the traditional separate design and two integrated designs by a laboratory experiment with a simplified system prototype and 42 students. The results showed that this design can improve performance and help knowledge-based tasks.
